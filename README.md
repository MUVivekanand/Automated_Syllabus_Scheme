The project aims to streamline and simplify the process of syllabus entry and resource management for faculty members, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency. 
Currently, faculty members manually input updated syllabi every four years based on every updated regulation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
This project provides a user-friendly, automated solution to alleviate this burden by offering default values and customizable options, allowing faculty to focus on content accuracy rather than repetitive tasks.
